Rust `std` modules with impacted functionality:
- arch - SIMD and vendor intrinsics module.
    - Technically available but in practice unusable (it is almost entirely `unsafe`)
- backtrace - Support for capturing a stack backtrace of an OS thread
    - Backtraces are currently always disabled.
- collection - Collection types.
    - `HashMap`'s default hasher (specifically `RandomState`) may panic if it fails to access randomness for its seed (note that this is the case for the `HashMap` in normal `std` as well). Users who hit this may be better off using `BTreeMap` instead.
- env - Inspection and manipulation of the process’s environment.
    - May panic, return `Err("unsupported operation")`, or have arbitrary results.
- fs - Filesystem manipulation operations.
    - May panic, return `Err("unsupported operation")`, or have arbitrary results (e.g. `is_file` always returns `false`)
- io - Traits, helpers, and type definitions for core I/O functionality.
    - Works on a case-by-case basis (usable with e.g. `Vec<u8>`, not with files).
- net - Networking primitives for TCP/UDP communication.
    - May panic, return `Err("unsupported operation")`, or have arbitrary results.
- os - OS-specific functionality.
    - May panic, return `Err("unsupported operation")`, or have arbitrary results.
    - Some infrequently used OS-specific submodules with complex APIs we would need to disable are entirely missing (`std::os::unix::net`, for example), although this will hopefully be improved.
- panic - Panic support in the standard library.
    - Some functionality, like changing the panic handler, is unsupported.
    - Panic information is not output to stderr (because writing to standard streams is not possible).
- path - Cross-platform path manipulation.
    - Path operations that do not rely on the filesystem or current working directory should work.
- process - A module for working with processes.
    - May panic, return `Err("unsupported operation")`, or have arbitrary results.
- ptr - Manually manage memory through raw pointers.
    - Technically available but in practice unusable (it is almost entirely `unsafe`)
- sync - "Useful" synchronization primitives.
    - Not actually very useful without threading.
    - Atomics function as normal, as does Arc. Anything backed by syscalls will fail.
- thread - Native threads.
    - May panic, return `Err("unsupported operation")`, or have arbitrary results.
- time - Temporal quantification.
    - `SystemTime` and `Instant` may panic, return `Err("unsupported operation")`, or have arbitrary results.
    - `Duration` should be fine.
